# Unit 06 Server-Side APIs Homework: Weather Dashboard

## Description

For this project, I created a weather dashboard using data from third-party APIs.  The user story is:

As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

There is a search input for the user to enter a city. The city's weather renders to the center of the page with weather condition icons. The searched city is then stored on the left panel. Upon entering the city in the input box, a five-day forecast renders at the bottom of the page. When user clicks on the previously searched city on the left panel, the city's current weather and 5-day forecast display again.

## Installation

I retreived the date data from Moment.js for the current date. I retreived weather data from Openweathermap.org.
